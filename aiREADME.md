## Usage

Translate-Python provides two main functionalities: transcript retrieval from YouTube videos and text translation. Here are some examples:

### Retrieve Transcript from YouTube Video

To retrieve a transcript from a YouTube video, use the `get_transcript_from_url(url)` function in the `get_transcript.py` module. Pass a valid YouTube URL as the argument to the function.

```python
from get_transcript import get_transcript_from_url

url = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID"
transcript = get_transcript_from_url(url)
print(transcript)
```

### Translate Text

To translate text to a target language, use the `translate_text(input_text, target_language)` function in the `lang_translator.py` module. Pass the input text and the target language code as arguments to the function.

```python
from lang_translator import translate_text

input_text = "Hello, how are you?"
target_language = "es"  # Change this to the desired target language code ("en", "fr", "zh-CN")
translated_text = translate_text(input_text, target_language)
print(translated_text)
```

These are just basic examples. For more advanced usage, refer to the code documentation.
